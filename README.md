Disease Risk Prediction
This project provides a machine learning-based solution for predicting multiple health risks using patient data. It includes data preprocessing, model training with VotingClassifier (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression), cross-validation, and prediction with risk level explanations. The Flask web interface allows users to train models, make predictions, and retrieve insights into risk factors. The model can be saved and reloaded for future predictions.

Key Technologies:
Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
Flask, SHAP for explanations
